     - ...

     - dosbox-x.exe

If you do want to use another format on the audio like ogg, you have to edit the .cue-file. You do this by open it in notepad or notepad++ and change the extension .wav to .ogg. Remember that the audio names does have to be the same in the cue-file as in the AUDIO-folder.
